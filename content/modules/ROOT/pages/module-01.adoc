= Smart Cities and Red Hat: Powering Our Future

Smart cities will change how we live, work, and experience our everyday lives. In this hands-on lab, participants get a last of the tools that will power this future. We will use the Smart Village Ansible Operator developed by transportation researchers and engineers from the Red Hat collaboration with Boston University to visualize live smart traffic light data in a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment.

In this lab workshop, participants will gain skills working with edge device data for a hybrid cloud environment, including:

* Smart device registration with FIWARE IoT open source microservices
* Sending message data that fits existing open source Smart Data Model schemas for counting vehicles, pedestrians, and changing traffic conditions
* Event-driven subscriptions to smart device data changes
* Sharing data securely between the Edge and the Cloud Custom dashboards for visualizing live GeoJson data on maps with Quarkus and Leaflet.js
* We will also demo how device registration and data subscriptions work on a real smart device running Red Hat Device Edge to publish data to the New England Research Cloud OpenShift environment.

== Introduction

=== What is a smart city?

Cities are growing fast and deliver an amazing range of services to their citizens. It is the level of government and government services that people tend interact with the most. Residents interact with their cities for many of the day-to-day services and issues that directly affect their lives such as:

* Public Services: services like refuse collection, power & water supply, sewage, and local road maintenance.
* Public Safety: police and fire departments, which are crucial for community safety.
* Recreational Facilities: local parks, recreational centers, and community pools.
* Building and Zoning Regulations: permits for new building constructions, renovations, zoning enforcement, land use
* Education: While the specifics can vary, many local governments have a significant role in the administration of public schools.
* Transportation: local public transportation systems, including buses, subways, or light rail systems.
* Health Regulations: hospitals and clinics, sanitation, vaccinations, and emergency preparedness.

A "smart city" is a concept that involves using digital technology and connected infrastructure to enhance urban environments, making them more efficient, sustainable, and livable. They improve the efficiency of city operations and services by coordinating systems that deliver and manage these services while connecting to and empowering citizens. They use different types of sensors deployed as various physical devices or attached to the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect data about the urban environment, collect this data over networks or wireless cellular or 5G, and integrate this data to run or empower analytics or execute automation.

Building a smart city typically involves several key steps and components: * Digital Infrastructure: This is foundational and includes the deployment of sensors and connected devices that gather data from the urban environment. This infrastructure supports high-speed communication networks, data centers, and cloud storage facilities.

=== How can we build a smarter city?

Making our cities smarter is closely tied to improving the information communications technology that we use to build them with, and there are a few key areas that we can focus on:

* *Integrated Information Systems:* Improve efficiency and service delivery by tying together normally separate data and systems. _This is the primary focus of this lab_: how we can build platforms that integrate data and systems to help us build smart cities.

* *Digital Infrastructure:* The deployment of sensors and connected devices that gather data from the urban environment via high-speed communication networks, data centers, and cloud storage facilities.

* *Data Analytics:* Analyzing data collected from various sensors and devices to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, water supply networks, waste management, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services.

* *Citizen Engagement:* Enhanced interaction between the city and its citizens, often through technology such as mobile apps and portals, for convenient access to information and services conveniently and provide feedback on urban issues.

* *Governance and Policy:* Efficient governance models promote transparency and efficiency. This includes regulations and policies that support data security, privacy, and ethical standards in the use of technology.

* *Public-Private Partnerships:* Building a smart city often involves collaboration between government, private sector partners, non-profits, and academic institutions to fund and implement technology solutions.

Many of these aspects can be addressed through platforms like the Smart Village Operator on Openshift and standards and ecosystems forstered by organizations like FiWARE

=== Challenges to realizing this future

There are of course many challenges to creating a smart city including

* *Funding and Budget Constraints:* Developing the infrastructure and technologies for a smart city requires substantial investment. Commercially available cloud platforms and open data standards and open implementations can ease funding challenges by allowing cities to roll out technology as needed and select from multiple options and providers.

*  *Technological Integration:* Integrating new technologies with existing infrastructure without causing disruptions caused by compatibility between legacy and new systems or scaling technology solutions from initial pilots to city or regional production deployments. Again we find that cloud platforms and open data standards and open implementations can ease this integration by providing multiple options with proven scalability and built-in flexibility.

*  *Data Privacy and Security:* As smart cities rely heavily on data collected from its citizens, ensuring this data is kept secure and private is crucial. Robust cloud and enterprise systems that have advanced security features and built in protection against cyber threats can help address significant concerns about how data is collected, stored, and used, and the potential for breaches.

*  *Public Acceptance and Engagement*: For a smart city initiative to be successful, it must be accepted and embraced by its residents. There can be resistance to change, particularly when people are concerned about privacy or the automation of jobs. Mobile integration and web based self service portals can keep citizens engaged and show how the smart cities add value and optimize services.

*  *Regulatory and Governance Challenges:* Developing appropriate policies that govern the operation of smart cities is necessary. These policies need to address technological advancements while ensuring they do not stifle innovation.

*  *Digital Divide:* Inequality in how city services are experienced and ensuring equitable access to the technology of a smart city is crucial. Smart cities can both help bridge that divide by identifying where these concerns arise and optimizing ways to address these. And when appropriate tecnologues are used, its an opportunity to modernize and build in accessibility enhancing technologies into service delivery.

*  *Sustainability and Environmental Concerns:* Although smart cities aim to enhance sustainability, the implementation of technologies itself requires resources and energy, which can have environmental impacts.

*  *Technical Expertise and Training:* There is often a shortage of skilled professionals who understand both the technological and administrative aspects of running a smart city. Continuous training and hiring of skilled personnel are needed. Open source apporaches allow cities to maximize the pool of talent and resources available to build a smart city.

*  *Coordination Among Various Departments:* Smart cities operate across various sectors and departments, and coordination among all these entities is necessary but often challenging.

*  *Long-term Maintenance and Upgrades:* Technology evolves rapidly, and maintaining and upgrading systems over time to keep them current and effective can be a significant ongoing challenge. Commercially supported open source solutions help keep the necessary technology up to date and patched against critical security threats.


== You are the city manager!

In this lab, _you will act the role of a typical city manager_, embarking down the path of a building a smart city. Like a lot of cities, you have too many cars on the road and too much traffic. Your city council and constituents have been calling and demanding you provide a plan to reduce traffic. Plus you are trying to make your city more pedestrian friendly to reduce the number of pedestrian injuries and promote economic activity in local commercial districts.

As a first step, you want to understand traffic in your city and are decide to deploy some smart sensors to measure traffic throughout your street grid. A common type of smart device for this purpose is a traffic light camera:

.A common traffic light camera
