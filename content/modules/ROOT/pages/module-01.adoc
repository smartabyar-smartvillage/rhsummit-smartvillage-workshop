== Smart Cities & Red Hat: powering our future

Smart cities will change how we live, work, and experience our everyday lives.
In this hands-on lab, participants get a last of the tools that will power this future.
We will use the Smart Village Ansible Operator developed by transportation researchers and engineers from the Red Hat collaboration with Boston University to visualize live smart traffic light data in a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment.

In this lab workshop, participants will gain skills working with edge device data for a hybrid cloud environment, including:

* Smart device registration with FIWARE IoT open source microservices
* Sending message data that fits existing open source Smart Data Model schemas for counting vehicles, pedestrians, and changing traffic conditions
* Event-driven subscriptions to smart device data changes
* Sharing data securely between the Edge and the Cloud Custom dashboards for visualizing live GeoJson data on maps with Quarkus and Leaflet.js
* We will also demo how device registration and data subscriptions work on a real smart device running Red Hat Device Edge to publish data to the New England Research Cloud OpenShift environment.

Because reactive/asynchronous APIs are more efficient and scalable, but are much more complex to build by hand, we can use code generation to build extendable APIs consistently, faster, and more secure with AI/ML Code Generation based on the well established https://github.com/computate-org/computate[computate open source project].
Increase Quarkus API and web developer productivity with OpenAPI Code Generation based on code comments.
Easily deploy new edge device models and edge device models following open source FIWARE smart data model schemas with AI/ML predictive code generation.

== Solution Overview: Provide a brief overview of your solution, emphasizing the innovative use of AI tools or technologies.

link:pictures/open-iot-data-science-architecture.png[image:pictures/open-iot-data-science-architecture.png[Open IoT Data Science Architecture\]]

* For any of the hundreds of open source Smart Data Models provided by the FIWARE Community, we will use AI/ML code generation technology to build, deploy, and visualize a working Edge-to-Cloud solution for any Smart Data Model in less than 10 minutes.
* The AI/ML solution generates all the code for any given Smart Data Model into a working solution.
The AI/ML solution will generate working Java classes with intuitive asynchronous initialization code, Reactive Java APIs linked to an OpenAPI spec, Handlebars HTML Templates, generated JavaScript, database initialization scripts, NGSI-LD Entity data context and documentation, and Ansible Operator Roles and Playbooks to register new smart devices to update entity data through the whole event driven subscription process through the FIWARE and Smart Village Platform.
* The generated Handlebars HTML templates and generated JavaScript build powerful analytics dashboards for any new Smart Data Model generated to enable full text search, autosuggest, filtering on any fields, grouped range data, grouped facet counts, nested pivoting on fields, multiple sort fields, field statistics, and JSON APIs.
* The AI/ML solution will also rebuild the OpenAPI Spec, update the database schema in PostgreSQL, update the role-based access control defaults, register new APIs in the Main Verticle, resolve all imports and dependencies from other projects for an updated Smart Village Platform codebase that successfully compiles, build new Ansible Operator Roles and Playbooks for registering new Smart Data Model devices, updating the smart device entity data through the event driven FIWARE and Smart Village subscription process through the Message Broker, IoT Agent, Context Broker, NGSI-LD Smart Village Sync, and Smart Village Platform, and view the new entity in the map in dashboard running directly from the OpenShift AI workbench in development.
* This AI/ML solution reduces the vast amount of software development, deployment, data import, and data visualization to only 6 minutes and 54 seconds, which would normally take months to develop, deploy, import, and visualize.

== Technical Details: Outline the technical aspects of your solution, including the AI tools, algorithms, and technologies employed. Be specific about the key technical components.

link:pictures/openshift-ai-workbench.png[image:pictures/openshift-ai-workbench.png[VSCode IJava java-17-openjdk OpenShift AI Workbench\]]

* Starting from a new OpenShift Cluster and Project, we start a new OpenShift AI Workbench using a VSCode image with JupyterHub, IJava, OpenJDK, and Maven dependencies installed.
* We deploy some edit role bindings so that we can deploy the Smart Village Platform components directly from a Jupyter Notebook in our VSCode Workbench.
* We install some Python dependencies like Ansible, since we have already automated the deployment of the Smart Village Platform with an Ansible Operator.
* From a Jupyter Notebook, we deploy all of the FIWARE and Smart Village applications:

=== Technologies deployed

The following technologies that we will be using during this workshop include

link:pictures/openshift-ai-code-generation-topology.png[image:pictures/openshift-ai-code-generation-topology.png[Smart Device API Code Generation with AI/ML Topology\]]

* MongoDB: A MongoDB No-SQL Database is required for FIWARE IoT Agents to store smart device registration data about each smart device in the project.
* RabbitMQ: A message broker like RabbitMQ can receive messages from smart devices and forward them on to an IoT Agent to process the message.
* PostgreSQL: A relational SQL database like PostgreSQL is required by the ScorpioBroker to store smart device context data for each smart device.
* ScorpioBroker: A FIWARE Context Broker like ScorpioBroker is required for storing smart device entity data of vehicle traffic cameras and pedestrian traffic cameras in the project.
* IoT Agent JSON: A FIWARE IoT Agent like IoT Agent JSON is required for smart device registration of vehicle traffic cameras and pedestrian traffic cameras in the project.
* Apache Zookeeper: A cluster manager like Apache Zookeeper is required for distributing messages and workloads to multiple pods of reactive/asynchronous microservices like Apache Solr and the Smart Village Platform.
* Apache Solr: An open source search engine like Apache Solr is required by the Smart Village application API to serve up API stored objects as quickly as possible.
* Smart Village Platform: The Smart Village Platform is used by researchers to configure smart devices for improving traffic light configuration, and running on reports on traffic simulations configured at intersections in the world.

=== AI/ML Tools and Algorithms

link:pictures/code-indexing-model-server.png[image:pictures/code-indexing-model-server.png[Apache Solr Code Indexing Model Server with computate\]]

* You can think of Apache Solr running in the same project as the OpenShift AI workbench as the Model Server in this solution.
* You can think of the model as an index of every detail of every Java Class, Java Constructor, Java Method, and Java Field of every Java Project in the Smarta Byar Smart Village project, Smart Village Platform, Computate Vertx project, and Computate Search Project.
Having your entire code base indexed in a search engine allows you to generate code that resolves complicated imports, links together foreign key relations including many-to-many, one-to-many, and many-to-one foreign key relations.
It also allows you to rebuild code that registers all APIs automatically as plugins to the main application.
* The model is built with the https://github.com/computate-org/computate[computate] project on GitHub.
A well established open source project written by Christopher Tate over the last 16 years to generate code as you save your code.
It's integrated with Solr search.
A new way to write code to make persistence easier.
* The algorithm will watch any directory for changes recursively.
When a Java class is updated, the code will immediately be parsed with a fork of the https://github.com/computate-org/computate/blob/main/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/impl/DefaultJavaClass.java[open source QDox Java code parser library], then every detail of the Java Class is indexed in the Solr search engine, the https://github.com/computate-org/computate[computate project] will then query the indexed data in the search engine, and generate intuitive asynchronous initialization code, Vert.x reactive APIs, Handlebars HTML Templates, Java Page rendering code, and more.
Imports are automatically resolved through searching through the deep knowledge base of dependent code projects in the Solr search engine model server.

== The workshop

=== before we get started

TODO: basic information or instructions about the lab environment TODO: Instructions on how to get to the openshift console, the openshift command line, etc TODO: any other

=== Install prerequisites

Many of the workshop components should have been created for you, as outlined in the technologies area above.
But you can review the process which was used https://github.com/smartabyar-smartvillage/smartvillage-operator[by the Smart Village Operator].
This operator installs the AMQP messaging broker, the FIWARE components such as the NGSI-LD context broker, an IoT agent, and the sync microservices.

=== The smart village operator

We will verify the correct operation of the smart villiage components by examing the logs generated by the operator.

GUI

. Open the openshift smartvillage operator by navigating to Smartvillage-operator-system ...
. Navigate to the TODO tab and open the latest log;
press CTRL-G to go to the end of the log file shown.

=== Create some smart devices

For this workshop we will be populating a traffic simulation that will model some smart traffic sensors that detect the flow of traffic through an intersection.
To make it interesting, we will let you find your favorite location -- like your hometown, birthplace, or honeymoon spot -- on a map and select the specific geospatial coordinates of interest.

As a smart city manager, the goal is to accurately model the IoT devices available to you -- either provided by a manufacturer, or already emplaced for you.
This data may be available from a device registry or other source -- but for planning and simulation, these devices are likely going to sythetic representations.

. For this exercise we'll use https://geojson.io to find and create the coordinates for you.
GeoJson is a standard data format -- a huge advantage for integrating smart IoT data in a smart city since we can pull common data into our context broker and share it with various data consumers.

Open a new tab in your web browser and navigate to https://geojson.io ; Spin the globe and zoom in and out to find a point of interest or use the search bar and type in the name of your favorite place.
Zoom in enough to locate single traffic intersection on the map

TODO: screen shot of the geojson.io interface with the basic controls highlighted and explained

You've need to grab several coordinates from this to complete our intersection -- so keep this map and browser tab opened and the map centered on your chosen location.

TODO: screen shot of a random intersection (eg, https://geojson.io/#map=17.1/35.658039/139.702912) and the coordinates we will be grabbing.
Figure X

For the purposes of this lab, we'll grab several polygons and several locations for each of our smart traffic cameras.
Use the mapping tools available in geojson.io to locate draw points in the map with the point tool.
THere should be one for each road near the intersection where a traffic light should be, typically overhead the center of the lane or road or immediately adjacacent on the sidewalk.
Then for each traffic camera, create a polygon indicating its field of view: typically the road or lane next to the placement of the camera itself.

TODO: screen shot of the camera locations and fields of view for the example intersection.
Figure X: Mark yoru smart traffic camera locations here.

When completed, the GeoJson.io tool will create the necessary data object, already encoded for you.
We'll need this data for our next exercie.

TODO: screen shot of the completed json data for the modeled environment.
Figure X: An example of the of the completed geojson generated for you.

If you need assistance with this portion of the lab, for example using the geojson tool or accessibility accommodations drawing or creating these objects, please contact a workshop facilitator.
Completion of this exercise is not required for later portions of the lab.

* The newly generated Ansible Roles and Playbooks in the Ansible Operator allow you to deploy multiple instances of the new Smart Data Model to the message broker, IoT Agent, Context Broker, NGSI-LD Smart Village Sync, and Smart Village Platform for a complete Edge-to-Cloud event driven solution.

=== Run application in development

image::pictures/youtube-run-app-in-development.png[Watch how I ran the generated code in development on my Youtube playlist,link=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKu_yfmp0hk&list=PLcVjtgfCeLvSxy4H0lc7HX5afbsKAsF8X&index=5]

* Deploy a new Service, Route, and NetworkPolicy to run the newly built code in development directly from the OpenShift AI workbench and view the new dashboard for new Smart Data Model immediately at the new Route.

== Key Features: List the key features of your solution that make it innovative and effective in solving the identified problem.

* See the thousands of lines of generated code build successfully with Maven.
The computate code generator can perfectly resolve all Java package imports successfully between all dependent projects because the Solr search engine has already been trained with every detail about every dependent project (computate-search, computate-vertx, smartvillage-platform, smartabyar-smartvillage projects).
* The generated Handlebars HTML templates and generated JavaScript build powerful analytics dashboards for any new Smart Data Model generated to enable full text search, autosuggest, filtering on any fields, grouped range data, grouped facet counts, nested pivoting on fields, multiple sort fields, field statistics, and JSON APIs.
* Every generated Java class, API class, and Handlebars template has an empty parent class or template that allows you to override any of the generated code that was implemented for you.
It's already built to allow you to override or improve any part of the generated code for complete flexibility.
* The newly generated Ansible Roles and Playbooks in the Ansible Operator allow you to deploy multiple instances of the new Smart Data Model to the message broker, IoT Agent, Context Broker, NGSI-LD Smart Village Sync, and Smart Village Platform for a complete Edge-to-Cloud event driven solution.

== Results: Share any quantitative or qualitative results achieved by your solution. This could include performance metrics, user feedback, or any other relevant measures of success.

Here are the links to the 21,493 lines of code generated across 3 open source projects using AI/ML by adding the PhotovoltaicMeasurement Smart Data Model to the project:

* https://github.com/smartabyar-smartvillage/smartabyar-smartvillage/compare/ai-combinator-hackathon?expand=1[smartabyar-smartvillage generated code]
* https://github.com/smartabyar-smartvillage/smartabyar-smartvillage-static/compare/ai-combinator-hackathon?expand=1[smartabyar-smartvillage-static generated code]
* https://github.com/smartabyar-smartvillage/smartvillage-operator/compare/ai-combinator-hackathon?expand=1[smartvillage-operator generated code]

Here is a description of our results:

* In 6 minutes and 54 seconds, I tested out building a new Smart Data Model Java class from scratch, replaced the Java Class I wrote with the AI/ML suggested Java code for the Smart Data Model instead, rebuilt the OpenAPI Spec and other project-wide changes, updated the database schema in PostgreSQL, updated the RBAC and Main Verticle, compiled the new Smart Village Platform code, built new Ansible Operator Roles and Playbooks for the new Smart Data Model, and deployed a new Smart Device and entity data through the Message Broker, IoT Agent, Context Broker, NGSI-LD Smart Village Sync, and Smart Village Platform, and view the new entity in the map in dashboard.
* This AI/ML solution reduces the vast amount of software development, deployment, data import, and data visualization of Smart Data Model data to only 6 minutes and 54 seconds, which would normally take months to develop, deploy, import, and visualize.

== Lessons Learned: Reflect on the lessons learned during the hackathon. Identify areas for improvement or insights gained through the process.

* Currently the Smart Data Model code generation writes the suggested code in the terminal output, but it could simplify copy and paste errors by overwriting the original source file automatically.
I hesitate to do this because it can be confusing and frustrating to the user if their hard work is ever overwritten.
The https://github.com/computate-org/computate[computate project] by default is built to generate code, but also provide an empty parent class where you can override any generated method, but never overwrite any code written by the developer.
Overwriting the original source code is against the established workflow of the https://github.com/computate-org/computate[computate project], but rewriting Smart Data Models could be an exception.
* Sometimes the VSCode Maven build integration interferes with running `mvn clean install` in the terminal on the project.
Occasionally I've had to remove the target directory `rm -rf target/` and re-run `mvn clean install` to resolve the issue.
It might be best to update the settings of the VSCode workbench to disable automatic Maven builds in VSCode.

== Future Recommendations: Provide suggestions for the potential future development or enhancement of your solution. Consider scalability, additional features, or broader applications.

* The hundreds of FIWARE Smart Data Models are only a sample of the kind of APIs and dashboards that can be developed with the `computate` platform.
